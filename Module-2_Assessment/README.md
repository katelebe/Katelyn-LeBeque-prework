This project is a fruit-themed, hangman-style game. The game takes in a user's keyboard inputs as a way to navigate
through it. At the beginning of each game, a random fruit-themed word is generated. It then listens to alphabet 
keyboard inputs. If a letter has not yet been pressed, it decides if the letter in in the word to be guessed or not.
If the letter is in the word, it is displayed in its position, if not, it is displayed sepertely. Once a correct word 
is guessed, a picture of the corresponding fruit is displayed. Once out of guesses or after the word has been guessed,
a new word is generated, and the process repeats.
