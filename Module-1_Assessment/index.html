             Hey guys! I am a recent graduate from St. Olaf College where I recieved a B.A. in mathematics 
             (and where the picture to the left was taken!). St. Olaf is known for, amongst other things,
             having some of the best college campus food in the United States, and I must admit that I already 
             miss it. 
             <br> <br>
             I'm originally from Northern Minnesota, which is my current location while working on this project. 
             Since being home I've been able to spend more time with family and our dog, Finnley. 
             <br> <br>
             Hobbies of mine include running, biking, and cross-country skiing. Recently, my brother 
             talked me into disc golfing for the first time, so I may add that to the list in the near future. 
             Other than that, you can find me doing newspaper puzzles while drinking my morning coffee, on a dog
             walk, or draining my phone battery while calling those I want to keep in touch with. 
             <br> <br>
             Want to know a fun fact? I studied off campus for a semester in Oregon where I learned how to milk goats!
